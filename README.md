Xcode and CoconutKit - Toolbar that animates away in landscape orientation

I have this self-made "toolbar" that is supposed to be hidden in
landscape mode. For more stability I rely on the library CoconutKit. I
am quite sure I am not using it correctly, either. My "toolbar" hides /
shows several times. Then the tools are gone forever, maybe fell into
the spaces in float calculations? You can actually watch the error
getting bigger when you turn the device several times.
